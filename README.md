# URL Shortener Service Project

This project contains multiple microservices developed in Go, deployed on Kubernetes with Helm, built with Bazel, and using Redis and Kafka.

## Microservices

- API Gateway
- Shortener Service
- Redirect Service
- Analytics Service
- Admin Service

Each microservice has its own Helm chart for deployment and uses Redis and Kafka for caching and messaging.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions in each microservice's README to set up the environment, build the services, and deploy them on Kubernetes.
